Ultrafast light-matter interaction has emerged as a new mechanism to exert control over the macroscopic properties of quantum materials toward novel functionality. To date, technological applications of non-thermal phases are limited by their ultrashort lifetimes and low-ordering temperatures. The hidden metallic charge density wave (H-CDW) in TaS<sub>2</sub> is among the most studied photoinduced metastable phases because of its technological promise. However, despite active study, the nature of the photoinduced H-CDW remains the subject of debate and potential applications have been limited because it has so far only been stabilized at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we stabilize the H-CDW phase at thermal equilibrium by accessing a mixed CDW order regime via thermal quenching. Using x-ray high dynamic range reciprocal space mapping (HDRM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), we reveal the coexistence of commensurate (C) CDW and H-CDW domains up to 210 K. Our findings show that each order parameter breaks basal plane mirror symmetry with different chiral orientations and induces out-of-plane unit cell tripling in the H-CDW phase. Despite metallic domain walls and a finite density of states at zero bias observed via STS, bulk resistance remains insulating due to CDW stacking disorder. By comparing our data to Landau-Ginzburg theory calculations of the free energy functional, our study establishes the H-CDW as a thermally stable phase and introduces a new mechanism for switchable metallic behavior in thin flakes of TaS<sub>2</sub> and similar materials with competing phases
